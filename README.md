## Chess

Over ten years ago, I wrote my own chess engine. It was really fast
(performance-wise) but it didn't play well because the search and evaluation
techniques were not very good.

Recently, my coworkers and I have been playing some chess, and I decided to
try writing a chess engine again to see if I can do better this time.
